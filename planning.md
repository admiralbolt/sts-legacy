Runestones for enchanting -- maybe in addition to normal relics. Runestone + shop to enchant something.

Maybe a new map node?

Definitely want to implement a skill / perk system somehow. I think a new UI element,
probably a circle spreading outwards to have crossovers between each pair of classes.
Need to think about this some more, think it will help give some more identity to the classes.

After stunning an enemy from electricty, the amount required to stun again should increase.

UI badge descriptions as a legend on card select screen.

Should slightly altar banners for different card types to make it more obvious attack, armor, gear, spell, prestige class.

Enchantment Ideas:
 - Energizing
 - Multishot
