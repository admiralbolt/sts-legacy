TODO:
 - Ranged attacks don't remove stacks of flight.
 - Electricity resistance
 - (from animator) UI badge descriptions as a legend on card select.
 - Slightly different card banners for different card types


Misc Ideas:
 - Two weapon rend
 - Gestalt - Two prestige classes
 - Assaisn - Stealth doesn't drop at end of turn. Bonsu damage basedo n stealth.
 - Runestone for enchanting.
 - Skill / perk system implementation.
 - Bloodthirsty -- Deals more damage to low health enemies.
