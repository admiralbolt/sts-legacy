Runestones for enchanting -- maybe in addition to normal relics. Runestone + shop to enchant something.


Weapon Specialization - A power that gives a rampage style affect to all attacks played.
Opportunistic Strike - 0 Cost retain attack that makes you lose energy next turn.


Some thing that gives ritual dagger effect -- maybe an enchantment?

Maybe a new map node?

Definitely want to implement a skill / perk system somehow. I think a new UI element,
probably a circle spreading outwards to have crossovers between each pair of classes.
Need to think about this some more, think it will help give some more identity to the classes.
